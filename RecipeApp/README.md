One of the most interesting and difficult projects i've done. 
The project is using https://themealdb.com free API.
The structure i've made is working with LocalStorage to keep added favorite meals in it, with a possibility to delete it from here(like in to do list).
Also there is a random meal displayed, which you can add to your favorites and change onclick to another random meal.
The search bar is automatically add wanted meal to favorites, if it is in a DB ofc.
There is also an option to see the description of how the meal can be cooked onclick on favorites.
