One of the most interesting and difficult projects i've done. <br>
The project is using https://themealdb.com free API.<br>
The structure i've made is working with LocalStorage that gives you a possibility to save favorite meals..<br>
Also there is a random meal displayed each time you refresh the page and change onclick to another random meal.As was mentioned before you can add it also to your favorites .<br>
The search bar is automatically add searched meal to your favorites, if it is in a DB ofc.<br>
There is also an option to see the description of how the meal can be cooked by click on favorites.The modal window contains the full info of how to prepear the meal<br>
